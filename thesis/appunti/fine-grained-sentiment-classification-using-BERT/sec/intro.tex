\section{Introduction}

Sentiment classification is a form of text classification in which a piece of
text has to be classified into one of the predefined sentiment classes.
It is a supervised machine learning problem.
In fine-grained sentiment classification, there are five classes: very negative,
negative, neutral, positive, very positive (there is a nice pic to show this).\\
While transfer learning (pretraining and finetuning) has become the de-facto
standard in computer vision, NLP is yet to utilize this concept fully.\\
Recently Google reserchers published BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers), a deep bidirectional language model based on the Transformer
architecture.\\
In this paper, we use the pretrained BERT model and finetuen it for the
fine-grained sentiment classification task on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank
(SST-5) dataset.
