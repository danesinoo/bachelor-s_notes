\section{Introduction}

The analysis of the corpora is divided in three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item summary of the information provided in the paper
		\url{https://aclanthology.org/D13-1170/}, which introduce the dataset
		for the first time;

	\item analysis of the dataset, in order to understand the structure of the
		data and the possible applications. Particularly, I've never done such
		an analysis, so I asked chatGPT to help me in this task;

	\item integration of the analysis after a discussion with the professor who
		follows me in the project.
\end{enumerate}
