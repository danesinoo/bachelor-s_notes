\section{Introduction}

The paper introduce a new method to compute and process the backpropagation in
complex structured input data. It is particularly interesting for its
application with trees and graphs.\\
We present a connectionist architecture together with a novel supervised
learning scheme which is capable of solving inductive inference tasks on complex
sumbolic structures of arbitrary size. The most general structures that can be
handled are \textit{labeled directed acyclic graphs} (DAGs).\\
Particularly, we present a simple architecture together with a novel supervised
learning scheme that we call \textit{backpropagation through structure} (BPTS).
It allows us to generate distributed representations for symbolic structures.
