\section{Introduction}

The chapter explain:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item basic notion of machine learning
	\item Naive Bayes and Decision Tree Classifier
	\item PAC learning theory and the Perception Algorithm
	\item Support Vector Machine and Kernel Methods
\end{enumerate}

Which means, I am gonna fast forward through the basic concepts (point 1 through
3) and I am gonna focus on the SVM and Kernel Methods.
