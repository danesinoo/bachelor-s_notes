# Notes

Here I keep the notes of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the
University of Padua.  
These notes aren't well organized and are written in Italian. Simply put, there
is a folder for each course I attended and in each folder there are some files
which contain some information about the course. Some course may be exhaustive,
some may be incomplete, there is no guarantee that these notes are correct or
up to date.
